# GameOfLife
Repository for my project in ASPP course

I will work on project suggestion number 1: The Game of Life. 

Provided in this repository is the following: 
- module gameOfLife.py which defines all necessary functions for implementing the game of life. 
- runGameOfLife.py which exectues the functions of gameOfLife.py
- testGOL.py which tests that gameOfLife actually outputs the expected pattern of a certain grid after 1000 iterations
- a .travis.yml file for continuous testing each time the code is pushed to GitHub using Travis CI
- file structure and additional scripts for packaging the gameoflife pip package, which can be downloaded using pip3 install uu-tora-gameoflife.
    Link to PyPI package: https://pypi.org/project/uu-tora-gameoflife/ 
    
    Test that the package works using runGameOfLife.py
